# Smart Traffic Signaling System Using IoT

## Overview  
The Smart Traffic Signaling System Using IoT is an intelligent traffic management solution designed to optimize traffic flow, prioritize emergency vehicles, and detect footpath violations. The system is implemented as a prototype and leverages IoT components such as IR sensors, RF modules, and cloud-based monitoring to enhance road safety and reduce congestion.  

## Features  
- Traffic Flow Optimization – Uses IR sensors to detect vehicles and adjust signal timings dynamically based on a first-come, first-serve mechanism.  
- Emergency Vehicle Priority – Identifies ambulances using RF transmitter-receiver modules and automatically switches signals to provide priority passage.  
- Footpath Violation Detection – Monitors and reports unauthorized vehicle movement on footpaths using ThinkSpeak cloud, allowing authorities to take necessary action.  

## Components Used  
- Arduino Mega – Central processing unit for controlling signals and sensors.  
- Traffic Light Module (x4) – Controls signal transitions at intersections.  
- Ultrasonic/IR Sensors (x4) – Detects vehicle presence at traffic signals.  
- RF Transmitter and Receiver (x4) – Identifies emergency vehicles for priority passage.  
- 12V Adapter (x1) – Power supply for system operation.  
- Buck Converter (x1) – Converts voltage levels for component compatibility.  
- Female-to-Female Jumper Wires – Connects different modules.  
- EM-18 Reader & RFID Cards – Used for future integration and authentication.  
- 12V 2A Adapter – Provides additional power supply for smooth operation.  

## Working of the Project  
### 1. Traffic Flow Optimization  
- IR sensors detect vehicle presence at each lane.  
- The system assigns green signals based on a first-come, first-serve mechanism rather than a traditional timer-based approach.  
- The Arduino Mega processes sensor inputs and controls the traffic lights accordingly.  

### 2. Emergency Vehicle Priority  
- Emergency vehicles are equipped with an RF transmitter.  
- When an emergency vehicle approaches a junction, the RF receiver detects it.  
- The system automatically switches the signal to green for the emergency lane while halting other lanes.  

### 3. Footpath Violation Detection  
- ThinkSpeak cloud is used to collect and analyze data from footpath sensors.  
- Unauthorized vehicle movement on the footpath is detected, and the information is sent to authorities for enforcement.  

## Installation and Setup  
### 1. Hardware Setup  
- Connect the IR sensors to the Arduino Mega for vehicle detection.  
- Integrate the traffic light modules to control signal changes.  
- Connect RF transmitter-receiver modules for emergency vehicle detection.  
- Power the system using a 12V adapter and buck converter for voltage regulation.  

### 2. Software Setup  
- Install the required Arduino libraries for sensor and module interfacing.  
- Upload the Arduino sketch to the microcontroller for processing input data.  
- Configure ThinkSpeak cloud for footpath violation monitoring.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Integration of AI for advanced traffic prediction.  
- Real-time traffic data visualization using a web-based dashboard.  
- Expansion to support over-speeding and signal violation detection.
